# Lab Tasks: Accessibility Improvements

## <a href="https://codepen.io/danhearn-the-looper/pen/qEBZjeB">Starter Code</a>

In this session we bring together everything you have learnt in the past 3 sessions to make an ugly website beautiful and accessible.
You will need to search the internet for examples, just like a professional web developer has to. Use resources such as web3schools and stackoverflow to help.

## Task 1: Improve HTML Structure
- Replace `<div>` elements with more appropriate **semantic HTML** elements.
- Add **alt text** to the `<img>` tag for screen readers.
- Replace inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick`) with proper JavaScript event listeners.
- Use `<label>` elements to associate labels with form inputs for better accessibility.
- Ensure all links use meaningful text instead of "click here."

## Task 2: Improve CSS for Accessibility
- Increase **text contrast** to improve readability.
- Use a **larger font size** for better readability.
- Ensure buttons and interactive elements have **clear focus indicators**.
- Use **spacing and padding** to improve readability and layout.
- Replace **cursive or difficult-to-read fonts** with accessible fonts like Arial or Roboto.

## Task 3: DOM Accessibility Enhancements
### Exercise 3a: Keyboard Navigation Fix (JavaScript)
- Use JavaScript to ensure that all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) can be accessed via keyboard (Tab key).
- Add appropriate **CSS focus styles** to highlight focused elements using `:focus-visible`.

### Exercise 3b: Dynamic Content Updates (JavaScript)
- Use JavaScript to detect and display updates when new content is added to the page.
- Ensure that dynamically added elements are **focusable** and accessible via keyboard.
- Modify buttons or input fields dynamically to provide better usability.
