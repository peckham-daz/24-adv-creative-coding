## Exercise 1: Variables and Conventions
**Task**: Create a `script.js` file (or use codepen/mimic) that declares variables for:
1. Your favorite superhero.
2. The number of pizzas you can eat in one sitting.
3. The best movie you’ve ever seen.

**Hint**: Use `let` or `const` to declare variables and use `console.log()` to print them.

## Exercise 2: Simple Math Operations

### Exercise 2a: Addition
**Task**: Calculate the total cost of buying a coffee and a croissant.

**Hint**: Use the `+` operator to add two numbers stored in variables.

### Exercise 2b: Subtraction
**Task**: Calculate how much money you’ll have left after buying a donut.

**Hint**: Use the `-` operator to subtract one value from another.

### Exercise 2c: Multiplication
**Task**: Calculate the number of ice creams you can buy with your money.

**Hint**: Use the `*` operator to multiply values.

### Exercise 2d: Division
**Task**: Divide your candy stash equally among friends.

**Hint**: Use the `/` operator to divide one number by another.

## Exercise 3: Conditional Statements
**Task**: Write code to check if a temperature is suitable for wearing a jacket.

**Hint**: Use an `if` statement to compare a number with a threshold and print different messages based on the result.

---

## Exercise 4: Arrays and Loops
**Task**: Store a list of your dream travel destinations in an array and log them one by one.

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through an array and print each item.

---

## Exercise 5: Looping with Conditions
**Task**: Count from 1 to 20 and print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.

**Hint**: Use the modulus operator `%` to check divisibility.

---

## Exercise 6: Number Classification
**Task**: Declare a variable with a number and check if it’s even or odd.

**Hint**: Use the modulus operator `%` and an `if` statement.

---

## Exercise 7: Number Checker Function
**Task**: Create a function `numberChecker` that takes a number as input and prints whether it is even or odd.

**Hint**: Define a function using `function`, take a parameter, and use conditionals inside.

---

## Exercise 8: Random Number Guessing Game
**Task**: Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and let the user guess it.

**Hint**: Use `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to generate a random number, and compare it with a user-defined value.

---

## Exercise 9: Function with Multiple Parameters
**Task**: Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given width and height.

**Hint**: Use function parameters and return the calculated area using the `*` operator.

---

## Exercise 10: Object Basics
**Task**: Create an object representing a person with name, age, and hobby properties, then log them.

**Hint**: Use an object literal with key-value pairs and access values using dot notation.

## Challenge Exercises

### Challenge 1: Shopping Cart Total
**Task**: Create an array of item prices and use a loop to calculate the total cost.

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the array and accumulate the total in a variable.

### Challenge 2: Guessing Game with Hints
**Task**: Modify the random number guessing game to give hints if the guess is too high or too low.

**Hint**: Use conditional statements to compare the guessed number with the target number and print appropriate hints.
